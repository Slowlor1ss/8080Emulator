# 8080 Emulator
 A 8080 emulator that will run space invaders, I mainly choose this emulater to get in to emulator development, and do some low level programming. It is currently still a work in progress as I sadly had to temporarly stop working on it due to exams.

## What is the 8080 processor?

The Intel 8080 is an 8-bit microprocessor it was released in 1984 and is the It's successor to the Intel 8008 it has a clock speed of 2 - 4 Mhz with the ability to address up to 64 KB of RAM. I am using this CPU as my first emulator to emulate space invaders, due to it's simplicity and thorough documentation and is thus perfect to get in to emulating bigger and harder things.
