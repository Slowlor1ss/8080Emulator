## What is the 8080 processor?

The Intel 8080 is an 8-bit microprocessor it was released in 1984 and is the It's successor to the Intel 8008 it has a clock speed of 2 - 4 Mhz with the ability to address up to 64 KB of RAM. I am using this CPU as my first emulator to emulate space invaders, due to it's simplicity and thorough documentation.
